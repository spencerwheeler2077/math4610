This Repository is to be used for Math4610, I am assuming it is to have a place to work on homework and submit things. Other than that I am not exactly sure how else this repo will be used.

This is the link to the task sheets for the course, https://jvkoebbe.github.io/math4610/tasksheets/toc/md/tasksheet_toc

Once we have created a software manual, I will add a link to it here as well.

**Routine Name:** Vector Operations

**Author:** Spencer Wheeler

**Language:** Python

**Description/Purpose:** This routine is a file full of different Operations that might need to be done on vectors.
The operations included are, addition, subtraction, dotProduct, outProduct, and scalar. 

**Input:** For all methods found in this file, they all take the same input, except scalar. 

This input is two vectors given as two lists like such,

    addition([1, 2, 3], [1, 1, 1])
These vectors can be of any size, but they have to be the same size as each other. 

The only method that doesn't take this input is scalar multiplication. It takes one vector and a single number. Like,
    
    scalar([1, 1, 1], 12)

**Usage/Example:**
There are different usages for the different methods,

addition() : adds two vectors together.

subtraction(): subtracts the first vector from the second. 

dotProduct(): finds the dot product between two vectors. 

outProduct(): finds the outer product between two vectors, the first input vector will be the left vector in the
multiplication. 

scalar(): returns the input vector times the inputted scalar.

**Routine Name:** VectorMagnitudes

**Author:** Spencer Wheeler

**Language:** Python

**Description/Purpose:** This routine is made out of 6 methods three will solve for different magnitudes of a vector. 
The other three will find the magnitude of an error vector that comes from two vectors. 

**Input:**
The first three methods, L1(), L2(), inf(), all need one vector as input, this vector will just be a list, like, 

    L1([1, 1, 1])

The other three methods, L1error(), L2error(), infError(), need two vectors as input, vectors just being a list, example

    L1error([1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 2])


**Usage/Example:**
This is the usage of each of the different methods found in this routine, 

L1() : This gives the L1 magnitude of a vector.

L2() : This returns the L2 magnitude of a vector. 

inf() : This returns the infinite magnitude of a vector.

L1error() : This gives the L1 magnitude of the error vector between the two input vectors. 

L2error() : This gives the L2 magnitude of the error vector between the two input vectors

infError() : This gives the infinite magnitude of the error vector between the two input vectors.
